# Pomodoro
Come study with this pomodoro timer built with tkinter in Python. The goal is to work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This will be repeated 4 times. Then, at the end you will have a long 20-minute break with the option to restart the whole process at any time. I added features such as a bell sound at the start of every new time segment, and the window will pop up for your breaks (even if you minimize it) (also, the window can't be sent to the back until after your break- so no cheating and working through your break!). Besides a smaller project converting km to miles, this is my first project working with Tkinter. The documentation is.. interesting, but there is so much you could do the options feel endless. Adding buttons with commands are my favorite feature so far. Likewise, this was my first time working with unlimited keyword arguments and differentiating them from unlimited positional arguments.
